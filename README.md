# Begining of something

The idea of this is pretty much to make a web interface for the brilliant castnow commandline tool - a plex server alternative, even though i'm not exactly sure what the plex server does...

## Goals

- Provide directory listings in a mobilefriendly way
- let the user start playback of files, (with optional transcoding like castnow)
- ??!

I'm pretty upset no one did this yet, maybe im just unable to find the project...
