# Begining of something

The idea of this is pretty much to make a web interface for tools like castnow (a plex server alternative, even though i'm not exactly sure what the plex server does)

## First things first

- List some kind of configured directory, maybe look for video files
- Try to play stuff
- support multiple sessions at once
- the usual ui such as stop pause etc, Also, like the castnow tool, it must have transcoding capability
- ?!?!

I'm pretty upset no one did this yet, maybe im just unable to find the project...
